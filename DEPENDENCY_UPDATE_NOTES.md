# Dependency Update Notes - October 2025

## Summary
This update addresses the weekly dependency update report by running `flutter pub upgrade` to update all resolvable dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

## Packages Successfully Updated

### Direct Dev Dependencies
- **build_runner**: 2.8.0 → 2.9.0 ✅

### Transitive Dependencies
- **_fe_analyzer_shared**: 88.0.0 → 89.0.0 ✅
- **analyzer**: 8.1.1 → 8.2.0 ✅
- **build**: 4.0.0 → 4.0.1 ✅

## Packages Not Updated (SDK Constraints)

Some packages cannot be updated due to Flutter SDK version constraints. These packages are pinned by the Flutter SDK itself:

### Direct Dependencies
- **meta**: 1.16.0 (latest: 1.17.0)
  - Reason: Pinned by `flutter_test` from Flutter SDK
  - This will be automatically resolved when Flutter SDK is upgraded

### Transitive Dependencies
- **characters**: 1.4.0 (latest: 1.4.1)
- **material_color_utilities**: 0.11.1 (latest: 0.13.0)
- **test_api**: 0.7.6 (latest: 0.7.7)

These packages are constrained by the Flutter SDK version and will be automatically updated when the Flutter SDK is upgraded to a newer version.

## Verification

The following verification steps were performed:
1. ✅ `flutter pub get` - Successfully resolved dependencies
2. ✅ `dart run build_runner build` - Successfully generated code
3. ✅ `pubspec.lock` - Updated with new versions

## Next Steps

To update the remaining packages (meta, characters, material_color_utilities, test_api):
1. Wait for Flutter SDK to release a newer version that unpins these dependencies
2. Update the Flutter version in CI/CD workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
3. Run `flutter pub upgrade` again
