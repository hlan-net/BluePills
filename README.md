# Getting Started with Flutter on Linux

This guide outlines the steps to set up Flutter development on a Linux system.

## 1. Install Flutter SDK

1. **Download the Flutter SDK:** Go to the official Flutter website ([https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)) and download the latest Flutter SDK archive.

   **Important for Raspberry Pi users:** Ensure you download the ARM64 version of the SDK, not the x64 (Intel/AMD) version.

2. **Extract the Archive:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the archive. Extract it using:

   ```bash
   tar -xf flutter_linux_*.tar.xz
