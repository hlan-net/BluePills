## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Jukka Gets a Headache
**Given** Jukka has a headache and needs pain medication  
**When** he opens BluePills  
**Then** he can quickly search for "Ibuprofen"  
**And** see that it's in the "Medicine cabinet"  
**And** see it expires in 45 days (still good to use)  
**And** see he last took it 2 weeks ago  
**When** he takes 2 pills  
**Then** he logs the dose and quantity decrements by 2

### Scenario 2: Jukka Discovers Expired Medication
**Given** Jukka's allergy medication expired last month  
**When** he opens BluePills  
**Then** he sees a red warning badge on the medication  
**And** it's highlighted in the "Expired" section  
**When** he taps the medication  
**Then** he sees "Expired 32 days ago"  
**And** he can mark it for replacement or delete it

### Scenario 3: Proactive Expiration Warning
**Given** Jukka's emergency inhaler will expire in 6 days  
**When** the app checks expiration dates  
**Then** Jukka receives a notification: "Your Emergency Inhaler expires in 6 days"  
**And** when he opens the app, the inhaler is highlighted  
**And** he can set a reminder to get a new prescription

### Scenario 4: Spring Cleaning Medicine Cabinet
**Given** it's time for Jukka to clean out his medicine cabinet  
**When** he opens BluePills and goes to "All Medications"  
**Then** he can filter to show "Expired" medications  
**And** see all expired items highlighted in red  
**And** he can bulk-select and delete expired items  
**And** see which medications need replacement

### Scenario 5: Adding New Medication
**Given** Jukka just bought allergy medication for spring

- Name: "Cetirizine"
- Dosage: "10mg"
- Quantity: 30 tablets

**Then** the medication appears in his list with expiration countdown

### Scenario 6: Finding Medication in Emergency

**When** he urgently opens BluePills  
**Then** he can search "allergy" or "Cetirizine"  
**And** immediately see: "Medicine cabinet - Expires in 120 days"  
**And** quickly find and take the medication

## Technical Considerations

### Data Model Extensions
```dart
class Medication {
  // Existing fields...
  DateTime? expirationDate;
  String? storageLocation;
  bool isAsNeeded; // PRN flag
  DateTime? lastTaken; // For as-needed tracking
}
```

### Expiration Calculation
- Calculate days until expiration
- Show visual indicators:
  - Green: > 60 days
  - Yellow: 30-60 days
  - Orange: 7-30 days
  - Red: < 7 days or expired

### Storage Locations
- Predefined options: "Medicine cabinet", "Bedroom", "Kitchen", "Car", "Office", "Purse/Bag"
- Allow custom locations
- Store as simple string field

### Notification System
- Schedule notifications at:
  - 30 days before expiration
  - 7 days before expiration
  - On expiration day
- Allow user to customize these intervals

### UI Enhancements
- Expiration badge on medication cards
- Color-coded expiration status
- Filter/sort by expiration date
- "Expired" section on home screen
- Storage location icon/text on cards

## Dependencies
- Notification system (already exists)
- Database schema update for new fields
- Date handling utilities

## Out of Scope (Future Stories)
- Barcode scanning for quick entry
- Photo recognition of medication labels
- Automatic expiration date extraction from photos
- Reminders to check medicine cabinet periodically
- Integration with pharmacy for expiration tracking
- Refill reminders based on usage patterns
