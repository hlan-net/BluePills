# Installing App on Your Devices for Screenshots

## Option 1: Internal Testing Track (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the app on your devices directly from Play Store.

### Step 1: Set Up Internal Testing in Play Console

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Select your BluePills app
3. Navigate to **Testing** → **Internal testing**
4. Click **Create new release** (if you haven't already)
5. Upload the AAB or review the existing draft release
6. Click **Review release** → **Start rollout to internal testing**

### Step 2: Add Yourself as a Tester

1. In **Internal testing**, go to the **Testers** tab
2. Click **Create email list**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Devices")
4. Add your email addresses:
   - Your personal email
   - Any Google accounts you use on your devices
5. Save the list
6. Make sure the list is selected in the internal testing track

### Step 3: Get the Opt-In Link

1. Still in **Internal testing** → **Testers** tab
2. Copy the **opt-in URL** (looks like: `https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.hlan.bluepills`)
3. This link will be valid for all your testers

### Step 4: Install on Your Devices

**On Each Device (Phone & Tablet):**

1. Make sure you're signed in with the Google account you added as a tester
2. Open the opt-in URL on your device (email it to yourself or click from browser)
3. Click **Become a tester**
4. Once accepted, click **Download it on Google Play**
5. The Play Store app will open
6. Install the app normally from Play Store

### Step 5: Generate Screenshots

1. Open the app on your device
2. Navigate to different screens
3. Take screenshots (Power + Volume Down on most Android devices)
4. Screenshots will be saved to your device gallery

## Option 2: Internal Sharing Link (Fastest)

If you saw an internal sharing link in the workflow output, you can use that:

```
INTERNAL_SHARING_DOWNLOAD_URL: https://play.google.com/apps/test/net.hlan.bluepills/15
```

### How to Use:

1. Open this URL on your Android device
2. Install directly (no tester setup needed)
3. **Note**: Internal sharing links expire after 60 days

## Option 3: Install AAB/APK Directly

If you want to test before publishing to internal testing:

### Build an APK Locally

```bash
cd /home/larry/slorba/BluePills

# Build debug APK (easier for testing)
flutter build apk --debug

# Or release APK
flutter build apk --release
```

**APK location:**
- Debug: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
- Release: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### Transfer to Your Device

**Option A: USB Cable**
```bash
# Enable USB debugging on your phone
# Connect via USB
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

**Option B: File Transfer**
1. Copy the APK to your device (USB, cloud storage, email, etc.)
2. On your device, enable **Install unknown apps** for your file manager
3. Open the APK file and install

## Option 4: Use Flutter Directly

If your devices are connected via USB:

```bash
# List connected devices
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run --release -d <device-id>
```

This installs and runs the app directly from your development machine.
