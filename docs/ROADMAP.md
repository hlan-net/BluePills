## Recommended Next Sprint (2 weeks)

**Sprint Goal:** Make BluePills useful for Matti's daily medication routine

**Stories:**
1. Today's Medications Dashboard (HIGH)
2. Enhanced Prescription Patterns - Specific Days (HIGH)
3. Low Stock Warnings (MEDIUM)
4. Basic Reminders (HIGH)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Matti can see what to take each day
- Matti can set up his Adenuric (weekdays only) correctly
- Matti gets reminded to take medications
- Matti knows when to refill prescriptions

This completes the core loop for US-001 and makes the app genuinely useful for daily medication management.

---

## Decision Framework

When prioritizing, ask:

1. **Does it help Matti take medications correctly?** (Primary persona)
2. **Is it part of the daily routine?** (High frequency = high value)
3. **Does it prevent a problem?** (Missing doses, running out, expired meds)
4. **Is it a quick win?** (High value, low effort)
5. **Does it enable other features?** (Foundation for future work)
