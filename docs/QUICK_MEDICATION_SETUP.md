### Adjusting for Split Pills

- If app shows more pills than you have, manually adjust by 2-4 pills
- Tap Thyroxine → Edit → Update quantity to match reality

This small monthly adjustment accounts for the split pills.

## Tips

- Keep split Thyroxine halves in a pill organizer or marked section
- Set phone alarm/reminder for Mon/Thu extra half-pill
- The app tracks your daily routine; you remember the Mon/Thu extra dose
- Physical pill count is your source of truth - adjust app to match when refilling

## That's It!

Simple tracking for your actual routine. The app handles the daily basics, you handle the weekly variations.
