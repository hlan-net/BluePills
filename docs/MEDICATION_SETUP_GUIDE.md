# Setting Up Your Medications in BluePills

This guide walks you through setting up complex medication schedules in BluePills.

## Example 1: Thyroxine - Daily with Extra Doses Twice Weekly

**Your Schedule:**
- 100mg pill every day
- Additional 50mg (half pill) on two days per week
- Goal: Maintain steady medication levels

### Setup Approach: Two Separate Entries

#### Entry 1: Thyroxine - Daily Base Dose

1. **Tap the + button** in the bottom-right corner
2. **Select "New Medication"** (blue button)
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name:** Thyroxine
   - **Dosage:** 100mg
   - **Quantity:** (your current stock, e.g., 90)
   
4. **For Frequency, choose one of these options:**

   **Option A: Simple Frequency (If available)**
   - **Frequency:** Select "Once Daily" from dropdown
   
   **Option B: Advanced Frequency (If available)**
   - Toggle **"Use Advanced Frequency"**: ON
   - **Pattern:** Daily
   - **Times per day:** 1
   - **Reminder Time:** (e.g., 8:00 AM)

5. **Tap "Save"**

#### Entry 2: Thyroxine - Extra Half Dose (Twice Weekly)

1. **Tap the + button** again
2. **Select "New Medication"**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name:** Thyroxine Extra
   - **Dosage:** 50mg (half pill)
   - **Quantity:** (your current stock)
   
4. **For Frequency:**

   **If Advanced Frequency is available:**
   - Toggle **"Use Advanced Frequency"**: ON
   - **Pattern:** Specific Days
   - **Select Days:** Choose 2 days (e.g., Monday and Thursday for even spacing)
   - **Times per day:** 1
   - **Reminder Time:** Same as base dose (e.g., 8:00 AM)
   
   **If only Simple Frequency:**
   - **Frequency:** Type "Twice weekly - Mon, Thu"

5. **Tap "Save"**

**Result:** You'll see both entries in your medication list:
- Thyroxine 100mg - Once Daily
- Thyroxine Extra 50mg - Mon, Thu

### Why Two Entries?

This approach:
- ✅ Clearly tracks your daily vs. supplementary doses
- ✅ Maintains accurate inventory for each dosage
- ✅ Provides separate reminders for each schedule
- ✅ Helps prevent missing the extra doses

### Recommended Days for Extra Dose

For steady levels, space the extra doses evenly:
- **Option 1:** Monday and Thursday (3-day gap)
- **Option 2:** Monday and Friday (4-day gap)
- **Option 3:** Tuesday and Friday (3-day gap)

## Example 2: Adenuric - Daily with Skip Days

   - **Reminder Time:** (e.g., 8:00 AM)
